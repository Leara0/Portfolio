        <h3>Snake | Real-time, grid-based game</h3>

        <p>
            This Snake game showcases my ability to build an interactive console application using C#. The project
            demonstrates core programming skills such as managing game loops, handling real-time user input, updating
            the UI using console positioning, and implementing object-oriented logic for movement and game state. I
            structured the code to keep the game responsive, with direction changes registering between timed movements,
            and included screen-size detection to ensure the game adapts to different terminal dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also implemented precise collision detection, dynamic growth of the snake, and consistent input handling
            to avoid unwanted moves. The project highlights my comfort with C# features like lists, tuples, and
            conditional logic, and reflects a focus on clean, readable code that balances simplicity with a smooth user
            experience.
