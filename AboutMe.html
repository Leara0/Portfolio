    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I bring a unique combination of scientific rigor, healthcare insight, and technical problem-solving to software development. With a background in biology from Cornell University and a Master's in Nursing, I've spent years thinking systematically about complex problems - from understanding biological systems to managing patient care.</p>
    <p>My career has taken me across the country and around the world, developing adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills along the way. After exploring healthcare and entrepreneurial ventures, I discovered my passion for programming through TrueCoders' full-stack development bootcamp. What excites me most about software development is the same thing that drew me to science originally: the challenge of understanding complex systems and finding elegant solutions to difficult problems.</p>
    <p>I'm driven by curiosity and continuous learning. Currently, I volunteer as a program coordinator, where I manage logistics, solve scheduling challenges, and coordinate teams - skills that translate directly to project management and collaborative development work. I also volunteer with healthcare advocacy organizations, keeping me connected to the intersection of technology and meaningful impact.</p>
    <p>I'm eager to bring my analytical mindset, healthcare domain knowledge, and fresh development skills to a team that values diverse perspectives and problem-solving ability.</p>
