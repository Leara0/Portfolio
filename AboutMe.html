    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I bring a unique combination of scientific rigor, healthcare insight, and technical problem-solving to software development. With a background in biology from Cornell University and a Master's in Nursing, I've spent years thinking systematically about complex problems - from understanding biological systems to managing patient care.</p>
    <p>My career has taken me across the country and around the world, developing adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills along the way. After exploring healthcare and entrepreneurial ventures, I discovered my passion for programming through TrueCoders' full-stack development bootcamp. What excites me most about software development is the same thing that drew me to science originally: the challenge of understanding complex systems and finding elegant solutions to difficult problems.</p>
    <p>I'm driven by curiosity and continuous learning. Currently, I volunteer as a program coordinator, where I manage logistics, solve scheduling challenges, and coordinate teams - skills that translate directly to project management and collaborative development work. I also volunteer with healthcare advocacy organizations, keeping me connected to the intersection of technology and meaningful impact.</p>
    <p>I'm eager to bring my analytical mindset, healthcare domain knowledge, and fresh development skills to a team that values diverse perspectives and problem-solving ability.</p>
    <h1>Alternate (longer) About Me</h1>
    <p>I bring a unique combination of scientific rigor, healthcare insight, and technical problem-solving to software development. With a background in biology from Cornell University and a Master's in Nursing, I've spent years thinking systematically about complex problems - from understanding biological systems to managing patient care. </p>
    <p>My journey has been anything but linear, and I've come to see that as a strength. Early in my career, I was drawn to the analytical challenges of science and healthcare. Along the way, I've explored creative entrepreneurship through jewelry design and cake artistry, learning about business operations, customer service, and the importance of craftsmanship and attention to detail. Each of these experiences taught me to approach problems from different angles and appreciate the value of both creativity and precision.</p>
    <p>My career has taken me across the country and around the world - from Alaska to Japan to California - developing adaptability, cross-cultural communication skills, and the ability to thrive in unfamiliar environments. These experiences have shaped how I approach challenges: with curiosity, openness to learning, and resilience in the face of change.</p>
    <p>After exploring healthcare and entrepreneurial ventures, I discovered my passion for programming through TrueCoders' full-stack development bootcamp. What excites me most about software development is the same thing that drew me to science originally: the challenge of understanding complex systems and finding elegant solutions to difficult problems. I find myself genuinely engaged when debugging code or architecting a solution - often losing track of time as I work through technical challenges.</p>
    <p>Beyond coding, I'm committed to continuous learning and community involvement. Currently, I volunteer as a program coordinator at my children's school, where I manage logistics, solve scheduling challenges, and coordinate teams - skills that translate directly to project management and collaborative development work. I also volunteer with the Coalition for Concerned Medical Professionals, a healthcare advocacy organization serving underinsured populations, keeping me connected to the intersection of technology and meaningful impact.</p>
    <p>I'm eager to bring my analytical mindset, healthcare domain knowledge, diverse life experience, and fresh development skills to a team that values different perspectives and collaborative problem-solving. I believe my non-traditional path has given me a broader view of how technology can serve real human needs.</p>
