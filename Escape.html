      <h2>Escape | Text-based Interactive Adventure Game</h2>
      <p>
        A text-based adventure game built in C# that showcases structured decision trees, inventory management, and dice-rolling game mechanics as you guide a cat through a castle filled with danger and choice. The game features multiple solution paths, a lives system, and dynamic scoring based on items collected during your escape.

      <h4>Technical Highlights</h4>
      <p>
        The application uses a switch-based navigation system to manage complex game state across multiple floors and locations. Location classes handle character interactions through inheritance—a base Location class provides construction and navigation, while specialized classes add progressively more functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        One technical challenge I solved was building the scoring system. The algorithm needed to calculate a total score while also grouping items by type and tracking both the point total for each category and which specific items belonged to it. I used a dictionary with tuple values (Dictionary<string, (int Score, List<string> ItemList)>) where each category name maps to its score and item list. Because tuples are value types rather than reference types, I couldn't change them directly in the dictionary. Instead, I had to pull out the tuple, update it, and then I could put it back as the new value.</p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Branching Decision Trees:</strong> Switch-based navigation managing player choices across four main areas with dynamic option lists that update based on game state</li>
        <li><strong>Dice-Rolling Combat System:</strong> Turn-based combat with weapons using different die values and modifiers (1D8+2, 1D10+2), animated dice rolls, and shields that reduce incoming damage</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiple Solution Paths:</strong> Guard encounters offer three approaches: combat, bribery with gold coins, or stealth evasion, each with dice-roll success checks and different consequences
        </li>
        <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Dual inventory structure with a pack (5-item limit) and coin purse, including a discard pile for dropped items and strategic equipment selection for combat</li>
        <li><strong>Lives System:</strong> Three-lives mechanic that respawns the player in the starting room when defeated, with complete game over only after exhausting all lives</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Scoring Algorithm:</strong> Dictionary-based system that categorizes collected items and calculates final scores with four different narrative endings based on performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates object-oriented design principles, complex data structure manipulation, and stateful game logic that responds dynamically to player choices throughout the adventure.</p>
