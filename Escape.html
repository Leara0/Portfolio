        <h3>Escape | Text Adventure Game</h3>
        <img src="images/EscapeOpening.png" alt="opening screen Escape game" width="500px">
        <p>This is a console-based text adventure game where the player controls a character attempting to
            escape a dark, multi-level castle filled with locked doors, hidden items, and guard encounters.
            I built it in C#, using an object-oriented design to manage game state, inventory limits,
            combat mechanics, and branching decision trees. The logic includes reusable components like
            dynamic menus, item interaction handlers, and life/death mechanics, all organized to keep the
            codebase maintainable as the narrative and options grow.
        <p>
            I focused on clean, testable architecture by separating content from logic, and I incorporated guard AI
            behavior, inventory constraints, and exploration mechanics. The challenge was designing a scalable structure
            for interactive storytelling while keeping performance tight and gameplay intuitive in a console
            environment.</p>
